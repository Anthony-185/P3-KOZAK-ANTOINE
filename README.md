# P3-KOZAK-ANTOINE

## Python project from openClassRoom, online School.

### goals modified, Please read the main obectives defines by OpenClassRoom, theses are my amelioration

UI ugly actually :-)
(sorry for english mistakes, working on it)

The main goal is to create a small Game which work on pygame, tkinter, or in console
or all in the same time

Add a map generator, which can generate 15x15 map, must be upgrade to be more flexible.
actually work, can generate a 15x15 map, with all items, the main character, the goal.

compose with :

Files | Description
----- | -----------
*main.py* | *main program, import others and run everythings elses*
**grid_module.py** | **the CORE of the program, which contains all variables and game functions (can work all alone)**
*tkinter_module.py* | *the tkinter module of the game, which work with grid_module*
__pygame_module.py__ | __the pygame module of the game, which work with grid_module__
macgyver V17.py | old version of the game, first step in this program (17 because i used to worked without GitHub), previous version in old version directorie.)


Tasks ask by openClassRoom:
- [x] running on pygame
- [x] size of map (15x15)
- [x] map load from a file (actually generated)
- [x] items position random
- [x] 3 items to collect, and go to the end of map

Tasks by me:
- [x] **Improve UI** *(very simple actually :D)*
- [x] all files can be lunched by itself all contains a `if '__name__' == __main__` statement
- [x] map random, generate by the program itself
- [x] running on pygame, tkinter, console
- [x] random size of map
- [ ] multi generator functions (only one actually)
- [x] map load from a file ( a Defaut map)
- [x] items position random
- [x] verbose mode -incomplete

## Description task by openClassroom:
### The goal is to create a small game, in pygame, with a small map, (15x15)
### with a characther (Mac Gyver), who must collect 3 items,
### and go to the final goal


# Have fun !
